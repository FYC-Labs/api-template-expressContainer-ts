## üìñ About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository contains the boilerplate for FYC's projects using Express + Typescript.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose
- Node.js 14+ (LTS version is recommended)
- Yarn

### Installing

Clone this repository on your local machine. After completed the requirements, including Node.js installation, first you'll need to install all application dependencies (node_modules), you can choose the tool (e.g. Yarn, NPM).

In this example, we will be using Yarn instead of NPM.

```bash
yarn
```

Next, run the application using

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Once the application started, please request MySQL database dump to the Product Owner or setup the application from scratch.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run tests, please execute the command below:
```bash
yarn test
```

Code coverage will be generated on \_\_tests\_\_ page

## üì± Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Run this application on docker-compose and access it from localhost:3333

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This application is ready for Docker and docker-compose deployment.

To backend deployment on a Virtual Machine, make a clone of this repository on the target, select the desired branch, and, after completing the requirements, run the following commands:

```bash
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose --env-file .env.ci -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

```

Once the application was built, copy the ```docker-compose.prod.yml``` file to ```docker-compose.yml``` with your environment variables and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.ci -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Make sure that your Firewalls, Load Balancers and your DNS is well configured. The backend application will be provided at port 3333 by default.
